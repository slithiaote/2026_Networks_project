# 2026_Networks_project

Given a corpus of documents, we use NLP methods to infer relationships between the documents.
Each document is a manifesto of a candidate in the parliament election in France. Consequently manifestos correspond to individuals and we actually infer a network of proximity relationships between the candidates' political beliefs.
The dataset covers several years, so we can study the time dimension in addition to spatial, sociological categories, etc.


# Data

The Archelec corpus is a collection of documents consisting of the manifestos of candidates in the elections of the French fifth republic. These documents were collected and digitised by Sciences Po

Archelec, les archives électorales françaises de la Ve République, du papier au numérique : reflet fidèle ou distorsion ? Odile Gaultier-Voituriez.

They have been imported and OCRed (transcribed) in Arkindex : https://demo.arkindex.org/browse/1bc39ca6-399b-47ca-9de1-ab2ef481cabb?top_level=true&folder=true
